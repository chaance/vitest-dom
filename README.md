This library is a fork of
[`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom). It
shares that library's implementation and API. It is intended to make it easier to include
its matchers without clashes between [Vitest][vitest] and Jest's environment or types.

See the [`README` for the original package](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom/blob/main/README.md) for usage details.

## Installation

This module should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```shell
# with npm
npm install --save-dev vitest-dom
# yarn
yarn add --dev vitest-dom
# pnpm
pnpm add --dev vitest-dom
```

## Usage

Import the matchers from `vitest-dom/matchers` once (perferably in your [tests
setup file][]), then pass them to Vitest's `expect.extend` method:

[tests setup file]: https://vitest.dev/config/#setupfiles

```javascript
// vitest-setup.js
import * as matchers from "vitest-dom/matchers";
import { expect } from "vitest";
expect.extend(matchers);

// or:
import "vitest-dom/extend-expect";

// In vitest.config.js, add the following
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    setupFiles: ["vitest-setup.js"],
  },
});
```

### With TypeScript

If you're using TypeScript, make sure your setup file has a `.ts` extension to
include the necessary types.

If you import from `vitest-dom/extend-expect` to run `expect.extend` for you,
you will get TypeScript support automatically.

```typescript
// vitest-setup.ts
import "vitest-dom/extend-expect";
```

If you want to run `extend.expect` yourself, you will need to include the type defintions either with a `/// <reference />` directive or including the type in your `compilerOptions`:

1. In your test file via a reference directive:
   ```typescript
   /// <reference types="vitest-dom/extend-expect" />
   ```
2. In your `tsconfig.json` via the `types` compiler option:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "types": ["vitest-dom/extend-expect"]
     }
   }
   ```
